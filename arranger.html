<BR><BR> Arranging music has been a passion for Jeffrey Sanders
since he first started writing songs for his own original rock band in the 1980s.
<BR><BR>
Through 3 albums of original material, Jeff composed most and arranged all of the songs
for this popular 5-piece rock-n-roll outfit.

Jeff's growing reputation as a versatile arranger led to his appointment as Musical Director
for the acclaimed Easy Street theater company. From smaller, sparser groups to large show orchestras
complete with choreography and extended overtures, Jeff arranged instrumentation and vocals.
<BR><BR>
Horns, woodwinds, piano, bass and guitar were all arranged by Jeff as musical director.
The Easy Street "Little Big Band" played to packed halls for almost ten years under Jeff's skilled guidance.
<BR><BR>
In addition, Jeff has arranged many ad hoc ensembles for special occasions over the years--
especially weddings and holiday shows.
